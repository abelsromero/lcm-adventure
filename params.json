To help manage this, two custom labels have been created to categorize issues:\r\n\r\n* _task_: important stuff that must be done soon. Pretty similar to _help wanted_ but for more prioritary tasks.\r\n* _open discussion_: open questions about the design of the solution. The main intent for this issues label is to promote discussion and collaboration on key aspects that may be urgent or not.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
