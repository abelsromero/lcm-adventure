Personal playground for a lightweight content management system

WARNING: this project is still heavily work-in-progress

== Licence
Currently Lesser Gnu Public License (LGPL) v3, however, the owner of the project revers its rights to change it someday.

== Collaboration
This is sort of a personal project just for fun and with no intent of becoming a production ready solution.
However, we take it very seriously and anyone is invited to contribute. To help manage this, two custom labels have been created to categorize issues:

* _task_: important stuff that must be done soon. Pretty similar to _help wanted_ but for more prioritary tasks.
* _open discussion_: open questions about the design of the solution. The main intent for this issues label is to promote discussion and collaboration on key aspects that may be urgent or not.
