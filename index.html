<p>WARNING: this project is still heavily work-in-progress</p>

<p>== License
Currently Lesser Gnu Public License (LGPL) v3, however, the owner of the project reserves its rights to change it someday.</p>

<p>== Collaboration
This is sort of a personal project just for fun and with no intent of becoming a production ready solution.
However, we take it very seriously and anyone is invited to contribute. To help manage this, two custom labels have been created to categorize issues:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<em>task</em>: important stuff that must be done soon. Pretty similar to <em>help wanted</em> but for more prioritary tasks.</li>
<li>
<em>open discussion</em>: open questions about the design of the solution. The main intent for this issues label is to promote discussion and collaboration on key aspects that may be urgent or not.</li>
</ul>
